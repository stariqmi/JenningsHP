The property tax cap is calculated separately for each class of property owned by the taxpayer.  It is possible, therefore, that you may receive credit for the tax cap on line 4b even if your net property tax bill is lower than this amount.

Charges not subject to the property tax cap include property tax levies approved by voters through referendum, as well as any relief provided by the State of Indiana Distressed Unit Appeals Board (for 2011 only).  In Lake County 
and St. Joseph County, this line also reflects debt obligations incurred prior to the creation of the property tax caps.  When added to the base property tax cap amount for your property, this creates the effective tax cap rate.  For more 
information, see the back of this document.
If any circumstances have changed that would make you ineligible for a deduction that you have been allowed per Table 5 on this tax bill, you most notify the county auditor.  If such a change  in circumstances has occurred and you 
have not notified the county auditor, the deduction will be disallowed and you will be liable for taxes and penalties on the amount deducted.
